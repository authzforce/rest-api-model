This package includes a sample client code that shows how to to send a XACML request to the AuthzForce PDP API. This code is in the class com.thalesgroup.authzforce.test.AzClient in “src/test/java”. 
If you are interested in testing the code but you don't have access to Thales Appsec team's Maven Artifact Repository, you have to copy-paste-overwrite the content of the 'maven2' directory from the zip package (produced by maven assembly plugin) to your local maven repository. The 'maven2' directory has a repository-like directory structure (for more information, see http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-assembly-plugin/examples/single/using-repositories.html) and provides dependencies that are not available on the public maven repositories, and therefore have to be manually deployed to your local repository with this simple copy-paste operation.

Then run maven install on the project.

If you are accessing the AuthzForce server over SSL, configure the keystore (resp. truststore) location and password in configuration element "keyManagers" (resp. "trustManagers") in file "src/test/resources/cxfClient.xml". The keystore is the one that contains your own private key and the certificate that you use to authenticate to the AuthzForce server (in "secure" profile). The truststore is in “src/test/resources”, you may have to change to an absolute path for the truststore location, depending on where you execute the code from.

Now, you should be able to compile and run the main() of the AzClient class mentioned previously. If you are using an IDE such as Eclipse, you can import the project as Maven project (requires Eclipse maven plugin installed), right-click on the new project > Run as > maven generate-sources, configure the keystore as above, right-click on the AzClient.java and "Run as" > "Java Application".
